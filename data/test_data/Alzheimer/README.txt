These, train and test data, should be used for evaluation which includes all the nodes with their nodeids (not idx, refer to idx2node or node2idx maps from the code.). 
This dataset also includes nodes which are totally isolated in both views. 
They should be removed from training as shown in example script for evaluation with logistic regression.
