train-test data for final embeddings to be fed into logic regression

Example code script:  Evaluate_logistic_regression_function_MANE-Attention.py is added to show how to use these dataset files for train-test with logistic regression for "attention version". In "without-attention" version only 1 final embedding output file will be used (i.e., no five-fold output)
